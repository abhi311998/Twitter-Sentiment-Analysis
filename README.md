# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This problem is from a competition on Analytics Vidhya. The objective of this problem is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets.

Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.

In the notebook, a very basic approach for solving NLP based problems is explained. Following topics are covered-
- Data Cleaning
- Tokenization
- Stopwords removal
- Lemmatization (With POS tagging)
- Bag of Words model
- Tf-Idf model
- Classification of tweets
